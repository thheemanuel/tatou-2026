# Individual watermarking method for Tom Ellström Johansson

# Steps that I would like to implement in this method
# From research I have understood that a good watermarking method should include certain properties
# Hosny et al. 2024 (10.1016/j.cosrev.2024.100662) and Warhera et al. 2021 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06909)
    # 1. Imperceptibility: It should not visibly alter the document's appearance

    # 2. Safety and precaution: Making sure that there are some safety implementations
    # we do not want to execute unneccassary code if it is not needed

    # 3. Capacity: The amount of information embedded in a watermarked image also known as data payload

# These references are more structured for images/audio/video, but I still believe they provide good reasonings as to why I am using them for this watermarking method

# Improvements i would like to have implemented further on
    # Robustness: It should be able to clear PDF handling: opening/resaving in a viewer, printing into a pdf, edits
    # Secure: More security. This is probably the biggest problem and for forgeability: Cao et al. 2026 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02384)
